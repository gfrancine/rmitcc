/**
 * Creative Coding 2026 - Week 6: Randomness and Noise
 * made with the help of Karen ann Donnachie
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates a simple random star field,
 * where circles of varying sizes and colors are drawn at random positions
 * on the canvas. The background is faded slightly in each frame
 * to create a sense of motion and depth, as if the stars are twinkling
 * or moving through space.
 *
 * You can experiment with different parameters, such as the range of randomness, stroke weight, and background fade to create different visual effects.

  // Fade background faster for trails
