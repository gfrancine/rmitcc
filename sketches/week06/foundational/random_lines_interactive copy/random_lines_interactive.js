/**
 * Creative Coding 2026 - Week 6: Randomness and Noise
 * made with the help of Karen ann Donnachie
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates a simple random walk technique,
 * where a point moves randomly across the canvas.
 * The position of the point is updated in each frame
 * by adding a random value to its current coordinates.
 * The line is drawn from the previous position to the new position,
 * creating a trail effect. The color of the line changes randomly,
 * and the background is faded slightly to create a sense of motion.
 *
 * You can experiment with different parameters,
 * such as the range of randomness, stroke weight,
 * and background fade to create different visual effects.

let counter = 0;
// this counter is only used at the end of the code for screenshot naming

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  background(0); // Start with a black background
}

function draw() {
  let x = random(width); // Random x position across the canvas
  let y = random(height); // Random y position across the canvas

  // Draw line from previous mouse position to current
  line(mouseX, mouseY, x, y);

  // Update position with randomness
  x += random(-1, 1); // Random horizontal movement
  y += random(-1, 1); // Random vertical movement

  // ...but keep position within canvas
  x = constrain(x, 0, width);
  y = constrain(y, 0, height);

  // Set color with randomness
  stroke(random(255), random(255), random(255));
  strokeWeight(2);

  // Move mouse to new position
  mouseX = x;
  mouseY = y;

  // Fade background slightly for trails
  background(0, 25); // Black background with opacity to create a fading
}
// these next 2 functions are for house-keeping,
// the first allows the canvas to adjust to window size changes
// which keeps the glitch effects full-screen and responsive

function windowResized() {
  // Adjust canvas size when the window is resized
  resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

// and this final one is useful for saving and formatting screenshots
// of the canvas, annoying to write but worth keeping it handy if
// you want to capture your glitchy creations in action!

  // Press 's' to save a screenshot of the current canvas
  if (key === "s" || key === "S") {
    saveCanvas(`glitch_tv_${nf(counter, 3)}`, "jpg");
